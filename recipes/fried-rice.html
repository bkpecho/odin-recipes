      Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a
      frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients such as eggs,
      vegetables, seafood, or meat. It is often eaten by itself or as an
      accompaniment to another dish.

      A quick fried rice recipe like you get at your favorite Chinese
      restaurant. Leftover rice, plus a couple of eggs, baby carrots, peas, and
      soy sauce is all you need. Garnish with sliced green onions, if desired.
