      Dashi is a basic stock used in Japanese cooking which is made by boiling
      dried kelp (seaweed) and dried bonito (fish). Instant dashi granules are
      sold in conveniently-sized jars or packets and vary in strength. Add more
      dashi to your soup if you want a stronger stock. You can use yellow, white
      or red miso paste for this soup. Yellow miso is sweet and creamy, red miso
      is stronger and saltier.

      Miso soup is a staple in Japanese cuisine and the Soup for the Soul. We
      enjoy it almost every single day, for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. As a
      Japanese home cook, I would also say that miso soup is probably one of the
      easiest soups you can make at home.

        In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine dashi granules and
        water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, and whisk in the miso
        paste. Stir in tofu. Separate the layers of the green onions, and add
        them to the soup. Simmer gently for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.
